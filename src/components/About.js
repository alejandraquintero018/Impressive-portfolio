                         A full stack developer with a certificate from University of California, Los Angeles extension campus in Full-Stack web development.
                         Through the bootcamp, I have gained proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React. 
                         Gained excellence using server side and third-party APIâ€™s and using databases including SQL, NoSQL, and GraphQL. 
                         I also have valuable experience using Express.js, Jest, Model-View-Controller Framework, Sequelize, and Apollo Sandbox. 
                         I have a strong background in chemistry, having graduated from University of California, Riverside with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry with research experience in quantitative method development and work experience as an Analytical Chemist. 
                         I have successfully been able to adapt the discipline, attention to detail, and work ethic from my background in chemistry to become an adept developer. 
                         When I am not behind a computer screen coding, I am training for my next race, with my next race being in April 2023.
